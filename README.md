# Tornado Injuries Final Project
### An Analysis of Injuries Compared to Magnitude from Tornadoes

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use a Linear Regression Model to identify, and then predict, injuries from tornadoes compared to the magnitude of the tornado. Our goal in analyzing the injuries from the tornado dataset is to determine if there is a trend in the reported injuries compared to the magnitude of the tornado. We can assume that a higher tornadic magnitude is likely to result in higher injuries. However, we want to see if other factors that can raise, or lower,  the injury rate. For example, does the starting location of the tornado, such as a specific state, seem to produce more tornadoes of a higher magnitude or tornadoes that stay on the ground for longer than other states? Will a lower magnitude tornado with a long path cause more injuries than a higher magnitude tornado that has a shorter path?

This analysis was completed as part of a final group project done by Matthew Baskette, Amie Costello, and Merab Nagwandala. 

#### Dataset Source
For our source, we used the US Tornado Dataset from [Kaggle.com]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/us-tornado-dataset-1950-2021).)) 
This dataset has over 67,000 rows of tornado data in the United States from the years 1950 to 2021. The dataset also includes columns for the magnitude as well as the number of injuries for each tornado.
 
 ### Segment One Requirements
- [x] Create an ER diagram and setup database for your data (if applicable)
- [x] Create an rough outline of your visualization dashboard
- [x] Create a paper based mockup of your machine learning model
- [x] Continue to use Github for all the data
 
 ### Segment Two
- [ ] A detailed README.md file that includes the project status, images, description, and results
- [ ] First attempt of a machine learning model, including a confusion matrix and accuracy score
- [ ] First attempt of a working dashboard
- [ ] Database that stores data for the project (if applicable)
- [ ] Draft of presentation

 ### Segment Three
 
## Outline of Our Visualization Dashboard
Our group chose to use Tableau for our visualization dashboard.

#### Number of Injuries Vs Magnitude
We want to compare how many injuries are caused as the assigned intensity changes.
 
#### Number of Injuries Caused per Period (month, Filter by Year)
In this visualization, we aim at finding out how many injuries are recorded per period throughout the years and months
 
#### The Change in Magnitude Over Time
The Visualization is aimed at identifying any changes in the intensity of tornadoes over the years.

#### Injuries Caused per Period Against Magnitude
The goal of this visualization is to identify the number of injuries recorded against the intensity of the tornado.
 
#### The Top Ending Location 

#### The Top Starting Location

#### Magnitude Compared to Tornadic Path Length
