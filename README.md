# Tornado Injuries Final Project
### An Analysis of Injuries Compared to Magnitude from Tornadoes
![tornado_cover](https://github.com/amiecostello22/Tornado_Alley/blob/main/images/tornado_cover.png)

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use a Regression Model to identify and then predict injuries from tornadoes compared to the magnitude of the tornado. This analysis was completed as part of a group project done by Matthew Baskette, Amie Costello, and Merabu Nagwandala.

For our sources, we used the US Tornado Dataset from Kaggle.com [Kaggle.com: US Tornado Dataset]([https://pages.github.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/us-tornado-dataset-1950-2021)). This dataset has over 67,000 rows of tornado data from the years 1950 to 2021. The dataset also includes columns for the magnitude as well as the number of injuries for each tornado.
 
 ### Segment One Requirements
- Create an ER diagram and setup database for your data (if applicable)
- Create an rough outline of your visualization dashboard
- Create a paper based mockup of your machine learning model
- Continue to use Github for all the data
 
 ### Segment Two
 
 ### Segment Three
